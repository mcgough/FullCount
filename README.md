# PlayerTracker

a [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application
=======
# FullCount
Timeline: 1 week

Built using MEAN stack:
MongoDB,
SailsJs,
AngularJS,
Node.

The stats and headlines are all scraped using the npm module Cheerio (sifting through the numbers was a lot of fun).

Do to the fact that I had less than a week to build this app, I wasn't able to put together any testing structure.
